### The Problem

I have been investing in stocks ever since I started working. However I use don't particularly use data to do my investments it's more or less just me reading the news and making a assumption of how a stock will preform in the long term which notably has worked. But i'm curious just how accurate can stock models truly be as my very first project.

This will be a **direction prediction project* where the model predicts if a stock will go UP or Down tomorrow based off different contributing factors.

### The Approach

First I will use the Yahoo finance API which is a completely free and trustworthy API so nice and easy to use, and i'll use pandas to look at the data.
